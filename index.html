<p>We need a leader. And we must surround him with deadly allies. His team must be strong, and their determination must be indisputable.</p>
<p>Being a team does not mean being together. It means acting as a team. (c) Rocks Uksby</p>
<p>I don't like working alone, dialogues, arguments, doubts are important to me (c) Marc Jacobs</p>
When one smart person comes to the company, another soon appears — talented people like to work in a circle of equals. (c)Bill Gates</p>
<p>To break through the wall with your forehead, you need either a big run-up, or a lot of foreheads. Anatoly Azolsky (c) </p>
